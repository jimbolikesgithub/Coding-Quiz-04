# Coding-Quiz-HW-04

--- This was the most difficult one so far. I tried so many ways; so many videos; so much Stack Overflow.
    And yet, I still can't understand truly how to do this. It was a long trial to figure out how to go from one 
    question to the next. We had to build a game, and get our timer reducted  ---

index.html - 
----------
* Added a lot of HIDE classes.

* Created multiple containers to hold the different sections I needed, and applied the HIDE classes to them.

style.css - 
---------
* Just styled as usual.

* Styled the hidden to make it a display of none.

script.js - 
---------
* A lot of code that I wish to resubmit.
* Got a lot of help from the internet, as well as YouTube and Stack Overflow
* Added function to start game, as well as calling the timer inside of the start game function (took longer than it should have)
